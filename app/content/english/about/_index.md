**In a world where online privacy is more critical than ever, LunaVPN emerged as a beacon of hope, a product of our unwavering commitment to your digital security.**

## A Vision of Privacy

At its core, LunaVPN is more than just another VPN service; it's a realization of our vision for a privacy-focused future. We were driven by a desire to offer something different from the sea of VPN providers using shared servers and standard practices. Our mission was clear: put privacy back in your hands, where it belongs.

## You Are the Hero

In the LunaVPN story, the hero is you—the user. We designed LunaVPN with you in mind, ensuring that your journey to online privacy is smooth, straightforward, and empowering. No complex setups, no lengthy contracts—just a simple, user-friendly portal that puts the power of privacy back in your hands.

## Escaping the Noise

The digital landscape is saturated with VPN providers all vying for your attention. It's a market where each provider seems to scratch the back of another, leaving you overwhelmed with choices. LunaVPN, however, stands apart by offering a simple product, a simple choice, and a straightforward approach—no BS, no complications.

## Cutting-Edge Technology

Our commitment to your privacy drives us to stay at the forefront of technology. LunaVPN leverages isolated services, ensuring that each VPN is tailor-made for the person using it. With our true no-logging policy, everything remains private and secure, just for you.

## Trust and Transparency

Building trust is paramount to LunaVPN. That's why we've made our source code available online, providing full transparency about how our service operates. We also place our trust in Auth0 by Okta for identity management and Stripe for payment processing, ensuring your personal data stays safe and out of our database. Safety, privacy, and security are our guiding principles.

## Your Online Guardian

In the vast online landscape, LunaVPN emerges as your guardian, protecting your digital life from prying eyes and potential threats. We are proud to be the product of a startup company based in Australia, RePass Cloud Pty Ltd. My name is Danijel-James, and I am the author behind LunaVPN.
