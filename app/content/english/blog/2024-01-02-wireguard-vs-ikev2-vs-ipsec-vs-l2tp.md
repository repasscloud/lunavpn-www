Choosing the right VPN protocol is crucial for securing your online activities. In this post, we compare WireGuard&reg; with other popular VPN protocols: IKEv2, IPsec, and L2TP. 

## Why VPN Protocol Matters

VPN protocols are the backbone of VPN services. They determine how data is transmitted over a VPN. The right protocol ensures a balance between speed, security, and performance.
