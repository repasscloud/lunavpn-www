### Want to Cancel Your Subscription?

If you'd like to cancel your LunaVPN subscription, please refer to our cancellation instructions [here](/detailed-cancellation-instructions/ "LunaVPN Cancellation Instructions").

### Is There a Lifetime Subscription Option for LunaVPN?

No, LunaVPN does not offer a lifetime subscription, and here's why:

1. **Continuous Commitment to Quality:** LunaVPN is dedicated to providing a secure, fast, and reliable VPN service. Maintaining such high standards requires ongoing costs for infrastructure, security, and support.

2. **User Privacy Matters:** We believe in safeguarding your online privacy. Some providers offering lifetime subscriptions might compromise user privacy by using cheaper and less-secure infrastructure, selling user data, or limiting upgrades and support to cut expenses.

3. **Flexible and Transparent:** LunaVPN operates without automatic renewal for any subscription. We give you the freedom to choose the subscription length that suits your needs. When your subscription ends, so does your data. If you decide to start fresh, you can easily create a new instance from our 32 global locations with a new IP address and credentials.

At LunaVPN, we prioritise your security and privacy and continuously invest in our service to ensure you receive top-notch quality. For more details on why LunaVPN doesn't offer lifetime subscriptions, please read our [full blog post](/blog/2023-12-01-lunavpns-choice-wireguard-protocol-for-unbeatable-security-and-speed/ "WireGuard protocol for unbeatable security and speed").

### Why is LunaVPN Priced Higher Than Some Other VPN Services?

LunaVPN takes pride in offering a unique and premium [VPN experience](/blog/2023-12-07-why-lunavpn-premium-features-justify-its-pricing/ "Why LunaVPN premium features justify it's pricing"), and here's why our pricing may appear slightly higher:

1. **Dedicated VPN Servers:** Unlike many budget VPN providers, LunaVPN allocates a dedicated VPN server exclusively for each of our clients. This means you get a server configured in the cloud just for you, complete with unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and enhanced security through a Cloudflare DNS server. This dedicated approach ensures your web searches and routing are more secure and private.

2. **No Traffic Restrictions:** At LunaVPN, we do not block any traffic, giving you unrestricted access to the online world. You have the flexibility to relocate your VPN service to any of our 32 global locations at any time during your subscription period.

3. **Multiple Simultaneous VPN Services:** If you require more than one VPN service concurrently, LunaVPN allows you to add additional subscriptions to your account, each with a different geographical location.

While LunaVPN may have a slightly higher price point, we believe in providing you with a superior VPN service that prioritises your privacy and security. Our commitment to excellence and tailored VPN solutions makes LunaVPN a valuable investment in safeguarding your online activities.

- LunaVPN reserves the right to suspend or terminate services, but rest assured, we'll provide you with reasonable notice before any such action is taken.
- If applicable, any unused portion of your payment will be promptly refunded to you.

### Why doesn’t the WireGuard desktop app automatically update?

Auto-update is available for the WireGuard app on [Android](/android-automatic-updates/ "Instructions to automatically update Android apps") and [iOS](/ios-automatic-updates/ "Instructions to automatically update iOS apps"). However, for the WireGuard desktop app, including versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux, auto-update is not enabled by default.

If you want your WireGuard desktop app to update automatically, please check the settings within the app to enable auto-updates. You can also manually download the latest version of the WireGuard desktop apps from their [official website](https://www.wireguard.com/install/ "WireGuard homepage").

If you encounter any issues with auto-updates or need further assistance, please refer to the WireGuard Support Team for help.

### Why doesn’t LunaVPN notify me that a new version of WireGuard is available?

At LunaVPN, we prioritise your privacy and choice. By default, we do not contact our customers to notify them of new releases. We believe in giving you control over updates.

To download the latest version of the LunaVPN app, please visit [our website](/downloads/ "WireGuard download client page") and manually check for updates. This approach ensures that you have full control over the update process, allowing you to choose when to upgrade your app.

We appreciate your understanding and commitment to maintaining your privacy with LunaVPN.

### LunaVPN Server Location Selection

LunaVPN offers you the flexibility to choose the specific city from which you want to deploy your VPN server. Our service doesn't use a traditional "location picker" on individual devices, but instead, you have full control over selecting your server location from our portal.

Here's how it works:

1. **Access the LunaVPN Portal:** Log in to your LunaVPN account at [portal.lunavpn.co](https://portal.lunavpn.co "LunaVPN Portal").

2. **Select Your Preferred Location:** Once logged in, you can choose the city or location for your LunaVPN server deployment. We provide a wide range of options, so you can select the one that best suits your needs.

3. **Complete Your Setup:** Follow the on-screen instructions within the portal to complete the server deployment process.

### LunaVPN Data Transfer Limit

LunaVPN does not impose throttling on your internet service provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider). However, it's important to clarify that LunaVPN does have a data transfer limit of 1 terabyte (TB) per 30 days of subscription.

This means you can enjoy a high volume of online activities, including browsing, streaming, and downloading, within the 1TB data transfer allocation during each 30-day subscription period. While this limit should accommodate the needs of most users, please keep it in mind when considering your usage.

We do not throttle service. Throttling is typically done by your ISP when you visit certain websites. Using LunaVPN hides the websites you access from your ISP.

### LunaVPN Data Transfer Exceeded

At LunaVPN, we provide a generous monthly data transfer limit of 1 terabyte (TB) per 30 days of subscription. This should be sufficient for the majority of users. However, in the event that you require more data than this limit allows, please don't hesitate to [reach out to us](/contact/ "LunaVPN Contact").

If you reach the 1TB data transfer limit before your subscription period ends, your LunaVPN service will be suspended for the remainder of that month. Should you require additional data, please [contact us](/contact/ "LunaVPN Contact"), and we'll be happy to assist you with your specific needs.


## Payment Processing with Stripe

At LunaVPN, we prioritize secure and efficient payment processing. That's why we've chosen Stripe as our trusted payment processor. Stripe is a leading online payment platform known for its reliability and security.

## Technical Support

### How Do I Know LunaVPN is Connected?

To verify that LunaVPN is actively connected and functioning, you can perform a simple check:

1. Visit [WhatIsMyIP.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
2. Once the page loads, look for the text next to **"My IP Location:"** which is typically displayed in a green box.
3. This IP location should reflect the VPN server location and not your actual physical location. If it does, it means LunaVPN is successfully connected and your internet traffic is being routed through the VPN.
