- **Dedicated VPN Service:** Your LunaVPN subscription grants you access to your very own VPN service, configured in the cloud exclusively for your use. It's like having a private tunnel to the internet, ensuring your online activities remain secure and anonymous.

- **Unique IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses:** Your LunaVPN service comes with unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, providing an extra layer of individuality and security. Say goodbye to sharing your IP with others; LunaVPN ensures your online presence remains truly yours.

### Want to Cancel Your Subscription?

If you'd like to cancel your LunaVPN subscription, please refer to our cancellation instructions here.

### Is There a Lifetime Subscription Option for LunaVPN?

No, LunaVPN does not offer a lifetime subscription, and here's why:

1. **Continuous Commitment to Quality:** LunaVPN is dedicated to providing a secure, fast, and reliable VPN service. Maintaining such high standards requires ongoing costs for infrastructure, security, and support.

2. **User Privacy Matters:** We believe in safeguarding your online privacy. Some providers offering lifetime subscriptions might compromise user privacy by using cheaper and less-secure infrastructure, selling user data, or limiting upgrades and support to cut expenses.

3. **Flexible and Transparent:** LunaVPN operates without automatic renewal for any subscription. We give you the freedom to choose the subscription length that suits your needs. When your subscription ends, so does your data. If you decide to start fresh, you can easily create a new instance from our 32 global locations with a new IP address and credentials.

At LunaVPN, we prioritise your security and privacy and continuously invest in our service to ensure you receive top-notch quality. For more details on why LunaVPN doesn't offer lifetime subscriptions, please read our full blog post.

### Why is LunaVPN Priced Higher Than Some Other VPN Services?"

LunaVPN takes pride in offering a unique and premium VPN experience, and here's why our pricing may be slightly higher:

1. **Dedicated VPN Servers:** Unlike many budget VPN providers, LunaVPN allocates a dedicated VPN server exclusively for each of our clients. This means you get a server configured in the cloud just for you, complete with unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and enhanced security through a Cloudflare DNS server. This dedicated approach ensures your web searches and routing are more secure and private.

2. **No Traffic Restrictions:** At LunaVPN, we do not block any traffic, giving you unrestricted access to the online world. You have the flexibility to relocate your VPN service to any of our 32 global locations at any time during your subscription period.

3. **Multiple Simultaneous VPN Services:** If you require more than one VPN service concurrently, LunaVPN allows you to add additional subscriptions to your account, each with a different geographical location.

While LunaVPN may have a slightly higher price point, we believe in providing you with a superior VPN service that prioritises your privacy and security. Our commitment to excellence and tailored VPN solutions makes LunaVPN a valuable investment in safeguarding your online activities.

### Subscription Termination Notification

At LunaVPN, we believe in transparency and clear communication with our users. In the event of subscription termination:

- LunaVPN reserves the right to suspend or terminate services, but rest assured, we'll provide you with reasonable notice before any such action is taken.
- If applicable, any unused portion of your payment will be promptly refunded to you.
