## LunaVPN No-Logs Policy

At LunaVPN, our primary mission is to ensure your online privacy and security through a VPN service. We are committed to complete transparency regarding the information we collect and don't collect. We proudly adhere to a strict no-logs policy, which means we keep no activity logs and no connection logs. Our dedication to your privacy is unwavering, and we go the extra mile to demonstrate this commitment.

### What Is a No-Logs VPN?

A no-logs VPN, such as LunaVPN, refrains from recording any details about your online activities. This signifies that we don't store your browsing history, downloads, or any sensitive data whatsoever.

### Why a No-Logs VPN Matters

Online privacy is a fundamental right, and your level of privacy depends on your VPN provider's practices. LunaVPN ensures that your online activities remain confidential. Even when connected to our VPN, we don't track or log what you do online.

Unscrupulous VPN providers may compromise your privacy by logging your data, potentially using it for profiling or sharing it with third parties. LunaVPN's no-logs policy is your assurance of genuine online privacy.

### How LunaVPN Protects Your Privacy

Our no-logs VPN policy means we do not collect or store any data regarding your online activities. This includes not monitoring the websites you visit, files you download, or apps you use. LunaVPN's commitment to this policy extends to a level where we cannot supply your data, even if compelled to do so, because it simply does not exist in our records.

### Benefits of Using a No-Logs VPN

Here are some compelling reasons why you should choose LunaVPN, a no-logs VPN:

- **Enhanced Privacy:** LunaVPN shields your online activities from prying eyes, including your ISP, government entities, and hackers. Without logs, your online behavior remains confidential.
  
- **Improved Security:** Our no-logs VPN employs robust encryption, safeguarding you against various cyber threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Ad Avoidance:** LunaVPN conceals your IP address, making it challenging for advertisers to track you. With no logs, there's no risk of your activities being sold to advertisers.

### Choosing LunaVPN for a True No-Logs Experience

Not all VPNs are equal in terms of privacy. When selecting a VPN, ensure it aligns with the following principles:

- A clear and transparent no-logs policy
- A commitment to privacy and security
- Third-party audits of privacy practices
- A reputation for maintaining privacy and security

LunaVPN, your trusted no-logs VPN, follows these principles diligently. We are dedicated to protecting your online privacy and security. Our servers are located in a jurisdiction with robust privacy laws, and we employ top-tier encryption to safeguard your data.

### No Logs, No Compromises

LunaVPN categorically does not store data on hard drives. All data resides in RAM, which is wiped clean every server reboot. We have engineered our apps and VPN servers to eliminate any sensitive information entirely.

Our commitment to a no-logs policy is reinforced by third-party audits. Independent security firms have reviewed and confirmed that LunaVPN does not keep any logs of user activities.
