What is the main purpose of LunaVPN?
LunaVPN is a privacy focussed, user controlled VPN service. We provision VPS instances in 32 countries to give the end-user the control over their own instance, by configuring stand-alone, no log policy servers. We protect our users data with trusted technology at lightning fast speeds with up to 8 devices connected per instance. LunaVPN is commited to offer uses honest and transparent policies and service.

What problem does LunaVPN solve for users?
ll other VPN providers use shared IP addresses and shared servers for their customers. We provision VPN servers on isolated instances as each client signs up for them, and never re-use them. When left unprotected online, your data such as bank account information and credit card numbers can fall into the wrong hands. LunaVPN keeps your data secure when you connect to a public wi-fi network, access services in your own country when travelling, or bypass censorship

Who is your target audience?
Anyone who wants to protect their online activity from prying eyes is the key focus of a VPN servicee and our target users. LunaVPN should also be targeted towards people who are travelling abroad so they can access internet services like they were still in their home country, giving them peace of mind

What sets LunaVPN apart from competitors?
Other VPN providers use shared hosting, but all our services are configured and setup per-customer. Each customer obtains a license from LunaVPN for a dedicated period of time, and is then able to choose where to deploy their VPN service. At any time during the license period, they can relocate their service to a different geographical location, and it will create a whole new instance. No shared IP addresses by anyone, and we offer both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses each time.

What are the core values and principles of LunaVPN?
Transparency. Honesty. Integrity. Responsible.
